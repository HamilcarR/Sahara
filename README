An OpenGL 4.5/C++ prototype 3D engine.
Will be rewritten from scratch with a new architecture,since this has been made for fun and testing,and doesn't take care of memory leaks,C++14
features like smart pointers , multi threading etc...

The new project will be located in the repository named : "Gayota" .


Still,here are some screenshots about what have been made so far :
